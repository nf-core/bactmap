## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

* [`Reference indexing`](#reference-indexing)
* [`Read trimming`](#read-trimming)
* [`Read subsampling`](#read-subsampling)
* [`Read mapping`](#read-mapping)
* [`Sort bam files`](#sort-bam-files)
* [`Call and filter variants`](#call-and-filter-variants)
* [`Convert filtered vcf to pseudogenome`](#covert-filtered-vcf-to-pseudogenome)
* [`Create alignment from pseudogenomes`](#create-alignment-from-pseudogenomes)
* [`Remove recombination (Optional)`](#remove-recombination)
* [`Remove non-informative positions`](#remove-non-informative-positions)
* Construct phylogenetic tree (Optional)
    1. Fast/less accurate
        * [`RapidNJ`](#rapidnj)
        * [`FastTree2`](#fasttree)
    2. Slow/more accurate, maximum likelihood
        * [`IQ-TREE`](#iq-tree),
        * [`RAxML-NG`](#raxml-ng)
* [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### Reference Indexing

Output files

* `bwa/index.`
  * `*.amb`
  * `*.ann`
  * `*.bwt`
  * `*.pac`
  * `*.sa`

> These files are generally not required except for in the mapping step

### Read Trimming

Output files

* `fastp/`
  * `*.html` html reports of the trimming process that can be opened in any modern web browser
  * `*.json` trimming report metrics in JSON computer readable formats

### Read Subsampling

Output files

* `rasusa/`
  * `*.fastq.gz` subsamples fastq files

### Read Mapping

By default there are no output files since sorted bam files are produced in the next step

### Sort Bam Files

Output files

* `samtools/`
  * `*.bam` sorted bam files
  * `*.bam.bai` bam file index
  * `*.bam.flagstat` bam file metrics
  * `*.bam.idxstats` bam file metrics
  * `*.bam.stats` bam file metrics

### Call and Filter Variants

Output files

* `variants/`
  * `*.vcf.gz` filtered vcf files containing variants

### Convert Filtered VCF to Pseudogenome

Output files

* `pseudogenomes/`
  * `*.fas` pseudogenome with a base at each position of the reference sequence

### Create Alignment from Pseudogenomes

Only those pseudogenome fasta files that have a non-ACGT fraction less than the threshold specified will be included in the `aligned_pseudogenomes.fas` file. Those failing this will be reported in the `low_quality_pseudogenomes.tsv` file.  

Output files

* `pseudogenomes/`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.fas` alignment of all sample pseudogenomes and the reference sequence
  * `low_quality_pseudogenomes.tsv` a tab separated file of the samples that failed the non-ACGT base threshold

### Remove Recombination

The file used for downstream tree building is `aligned_pseudogenomes.filtered_polymorphic_sites.fasta`. The other files are described in the [gubbins documentation](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/gubbins#output-files)

Output files

* `gubbins/`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.branch_base_reconstruction.embl`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.filtered_polymorphic_sites.fasta`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.filtered_polymorphic_sites.phylip`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.final_tree.tre`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.node_labelled.final_tree.tre`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.per_branch_statistics.csv`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.recombination_predictions.embl`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.recombination_predictions.gff`
  * `aligned_pseudogenomes.summary_of_snp_distribution.vcf`

### Remove Non-informative Positions

Output files

* `snpsites/`
  * `constant.sites.txt` A file with the number of constant sites for each base
  * `filtered_alignment.fas` Alignment with only informative positions (those positions that have at least one alternative variant base)

### RapidNJ

Output files

* `rapidnj/`
  * `rapidnj_phylogeny.tre` A newick tree built with RapidNJ

### FastTree

Output files

* `fasttree/`
  * `fasttree_phylogeny.tre` A newick tree built with FastTree

### IQ-TREE

Output files

* `iqtree/`
  * `*.treefile` A ML tree built with IQ-TREE with support values for branches based on bootstrapping

### RAxML-NG

Output files

* `iqtree/`
  * `output.raxml.bestTree` A ML tree built with RAxML-NG selected as the best after running ML
  * `output.raxml.support` A ML tree built with RAxML-NG with support values for branches based on bootstrapping

### Pipeline information

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
